    "Based on the analysis of the SFO Airport's utility data from 2013 to 2018, the following conclusions were drawn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Passengers**: There was a significant **increase** in the number of passengers, with a total change of approximately **12.79 million**. This suggests a substantial growth in airport traffic over these years.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Water**: The change in water usage was minimal, with a total change of about **19.3 units**. This indicates that water consumption at the airport remained relatively stable during this period.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gas**: There was a **decrease** in gas usage by approximately **265,587.5 units**. This reduction might be indicative of improved energy efficiency or changes in operational practices at the airport.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Electricity**: The most noticeable change was in electricity usage, which saw a **decrease** of about **19.07 million units**. This significant reduction could be attributed to a variety of factors, including the adoption of energy-saving measures, upgrades to more efficient systems, or overall changes in the scale and nature of airport operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, **Electricity** experienced the most substantial decrease in usage, reflecting a possible shift towards energy efficiency. On the other hand, the **Passengers** category showed the largest increase, likely mirroring the growth in airport usage and traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings provide valuable insights into the utility consumption trends at the SFO Airport, highlighting areas of significant change and potential focus for future efficiency improvements or operational adjustments.\n"
